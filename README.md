# React-BusinessApp
This repository contains all the files for the front and back-end of the Water Dog Pool Care web data portal.

The WaterDog_REST_API folder contains the files needed to host the REST services on localhost. 

The waterdog_react_app folder contains all the files needed to run the web data portal. 
The web portal was written using ReactJS and needs to have Bootstrap installed on your machine for it to import the necessary files.
If you try to run this application you need to make sure the URL of the REST service matches what is called in the app.
